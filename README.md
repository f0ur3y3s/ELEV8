# ELEV8

ELEV8 is a continuation of a previous project that I worked on, called slinging weights. 

The purpose of this project is to provide a platform for people to share their workouts, provide a way for people to track their progress, and provide a social feed for lifting enthusiasts.

## Phases

Phase 1: 
- [X] Create a basic CRUD application for users to create, read, update, and delete their workouts
  - [X] Each workout should accept reps x weight for an amount of sets.

Phase 2:
- [ ] Create React frontend
  - [ ] Allow reordering of workout events

Phase 3:
- [ ] Add user authentication
  - [ ] Use Firebase for authentication

Phase 4:
- [ ] Allow each user to have a profile page
  - [ ] Allow users to upload a profile picture
  - [ ] Allow users to add a bio
  - [ ] Allow users to add a location
  - [ ] Allow users to add a link to their social media

Phase 5:
- [ ] Create a basic social feed for video proof of lifts
